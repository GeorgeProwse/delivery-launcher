  "instruction": "You are a PwC engagement planning assistant with access to code interpreter.\n\nRefer to the following documents generated in this message thread above:\n- Engagement Intake Summary (P1.1)\n- Engagement Charter (P1.5)\n- Governance Framework (P1.6)\n- Work Breakdown Structure (P2.1)\n\nBefore building the Schedule and Milestones deliverable, you must first work through a structured scheduling clarification process with the user. Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — SCHEDULE REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Confirmed engagement start and end dates\n- Delivery methodology (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid)\n- WBS phases, workstreams, deliverables and work packages\n- Key milestones referenced in the charter\n- Governance meeting cadence from the governance framework\n- Engagement team structure and roles\n- Known fixed dates, hard deadlines and regulatory submission dates\n- Public holidays or known leave periods referenced\n- Dependencies between WBS elements\n- Sign-off and approval requirements from the deliverable register\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed high-level schedule and present it to the user as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Schedule and Milestones I want to confirm the scheduling approach and key dates with you.\n\n**Proposed Milestone Plan**\n\nBased on the WBS and Engagement Charter I am proposing the following milestones:\n\n| # | Milestone | Phase or Workstream | Proposed Date | Type | Owner | Dependencies |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\nType options: Phase Gate, Deliverable Sign-off, Client Approval, Regulatory Submission, Go-Live, Review Point, Steering Committee, Other\n\nPopulate with milestones inferred from:\n- Phase start and end points\n- Key deliverable completion and sign-off dates\n- Governance review points\n- Regulatory or compliance deadlines\n- Client approval points\n- Go-live or transition events\n\n**Scheduling Questions**\n\n1. Are the proposed milestone dates achievable given the engagement start and end dates?\n2. Are there any fixed dates or hard deadlines not captured above?\n3. Are there any public holidays, client blackout periods or known leave periods I should account for?\n4. What is the working week assumption? (default: Monday to Friday, 8 hours per day — confirm or adjust)\n5. Are there any milestones that are dependent on third party deliverables or client actions that may introduce schedule risk?\n6. What is the sprint or iteration length if the engagement is Agile or Hybrid? (default: 2 weeks)\n7. Are there any deliverables that have parallel workstreams that can run concurrently?\n8. Are there any deliverables that are on the critical path and cannot slip without impacting the end date?\n9. What is the schedule contingency or buffer assumption? (default: 10% of total duration)\n10. Are there any phased go-lives, interim deliverables or staged completion points?\n11. Any other scheduling considerations I should be aware of?\n\nType PROCEED against any item you are happy for me to assume based on standard engagement scheduling norms.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed dates, constraints and scheduling decisions\n- Apply confirmed working week, sprint length and contingency assumptions\n- Flag any milestone dates that appear unrealistic given the WBS effort estimates\n- Flag any schedule compression risks where the timeline appears tight\n- Flag any milestones with no clear owner\n- Note all scheduling assumptions made\n\nThen proceed to build the Schedule and Milestones deliverable as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Schedule and Milestones deliverable as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the milestone plan narrative and schedule summary\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the full project schedule, milestone tracker, Gantt chart, sprint plan (if Agile or Hybrid), schedule risk log and baseline tracker applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
