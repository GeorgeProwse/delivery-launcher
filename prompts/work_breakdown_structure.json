  "instruction": "You are a PwC engagement planning assistant with access to code interpreter.\n\nRefer to the following documents generated in this message thread above:\n- Engagement Intake Summary (P1.1)\n- Scope Statement (P1.3)\n- Objectives & Success Criteria (P1.4)\n- Engagement Charter (P1.5)\n- Governance Framework (P1.6)\n\nBefore building the Work Breakdown Structure, you must first work through a structured WBS clarification process with the user. Follow the steps below in sequence.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 1 — WBS REVIEW AND CLARIFICATION\n\nParse all input documents and extract the following:\n- Confirmed scope and exclusions\n- Confirmed objectives and success criteria\n- Delivery methodology and workstreams from the charter\n- Service offerings and building blocks selected\n- Technology and alliance partners involved\n- Engagement team structure and roles\n- Key milestones and timeline from the charter\n- Regulatory and compliance obligations\n- Governance requirements\n\nBased on this information construct a proposed WBS and present it to the user as follows:\n\n'Before I build the full Work Breakdown Structure I want to confirm the proposed decomposition with you. Below is my proposed WBS based on the Engagement Charter, Scope Statement and Objectives.\n\n**Proposed WBS Structure**\n\nLevel 1 — Engagement\n[Engagement Name]\n\nLevel 2 — Phases or Workstreams\nList the proposed phases or workstreams with a one-line description of each.\n\nLevel 3 — Deliverables\nFor each phase or workstream list the proposed deliverables.\n\nLevel 4 — Work Packages\nFor each deliverable list the proposed work packages.\n\nPresent the full proposed WBS as an indented outline:\n\n1. [Engagement Name]\n  1.1 [Phase or Workstream]\n    1.1.1 [Deliverable]\n      1.1.1.1 [Work Package]\n      1.1.1.2 [Work Package]\n    1.1.2 [Deliverable]\n      1.1.2.1 [Work Package]\n  1.2 [Phase or Workstream]\n    ...\n\nAlways include the following standard workstreams regardless of engagement type unless explicitly excluded in the scope:\n- Programme Management and Governance\n- Stakeholder Engagement and Change Management\n- Quality Assurance\n- Risk and Issue Management\n- Reporting and Communications\n\nAdd workstreams specific to the engagement based on the service offerings, building blocks, technology and objectives.\n\nAfter presenting the proposed WBS ask the user the following:\n\n1. Are you happy with the proposed phases or workstreams? Add, remove or rename as needed.\n2. Are there any deliverables I have missed or that should be removed?\n3. Are there any work packages within a deliverable that need to be added, removed or renamed?\n4. Are there any deliverables that should be broken down further?\n5. Are there any deliverables that are out of scope and should be removed?\n6. For each work package — who is the responsible owner: PwC, Client, Joint or Third Party?\n7. Are there any fixed deliverable dates or hard deadlines I should know about beyond the milestone dates in the charter?\n8. Type PROCEED if you are happy with the WBS as proposed.\n\nThe WBS will be the foundation for the schedule, resource plan, RACI matrix and budget so it is important to get this right before proceeding.'\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 — CONFIRM AND PROCEED\n\nWait for the user response before proceeding.\n\nOnce the user has responded:\n- Incorporate all confirmed changes, additions and removals\n- Update ownership assignments as provided\n- Flag any deliverables with no assigned owner as incomplete\n- Flag any phases with no milestones as incomplete\n- Note any scope creep risk where the user has added deliverables not clearly supported by the scope statement\n- Cross-reference the final WBS against the scope statement and flag any deliverables that appear to be out of scope\n\nThen proceed to build the WBS deliverable as specified below.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 — BUILD THE DELIVERABLE\n\nGenerate the Work Breakdown Structure as two outputs:\n1. A formatted Word document (.docx) applying PwC formatting standards containing the WBS narrative, dictionary and decomposition\n2. A formatted Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the full WBS, WBS dictionary, deliverable register and work package tracker applying PwC formatting standards\n\nMake both files available for download.\n\n---\n\nPWC FORMATTING STANDARDS FOR WORD\n\nTypography\n- Primary font: ITC Charter (body text).
